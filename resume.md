Testimonials
------------

Thanks so much everyone for last night, I had great feedback on all of your presentations both last night and this afternoon at the IEEE interviews - in fact several of the people today cited your presentations when we asked why they wanted to work at Telogis.  They clearly felt like they could relate to you and came away with the impression that Telogis employs really bright people, tackles interesting challenging problems, and is a fun place to work - which is just what we want.  Fantastic work - really appreciate your efforts. - **Nicki Graff (Human Resources)**
