I have over four years of experience as a software engineer working as a full stack engineer, and as a front-end engineer.

I excel in delivering and improving features that improve the user experience - including factors that aren't obvious such as performance and intuition.

I believe there is no superior programming language or framework, and that problems should be analyzed for their individual needs.

I understand that most issues arise from invalid assumptions, and that effective communication can mitigate this. I have experience working and communicating in teams with multiple roles that change often.

Work Experience
-

*  Feb 2016 - Present: **Number26** - **Berlin**

	Frontend Developer
	- Javascript, Backbone, SASS, Gulp
	- Banking but better

	At Number26 I worked on the main web application which served around half a million page views a month. There was a strong focus on improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from an outsourced developer, all while maintaining feature deployment frequency.

	There was a high focus on design and user experience, as I worked alongside a team of talented designers.

	Features I worked on included a bank account switching service, a transaction screen redesign, and overdraft functionality.

*  Oct 2014 - Jan 2016: **Blacklane** - **Berlin**

    Frontend Developer
    - Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, SASS
    - Your Professional Driver

	At Blacklane I assisted with the release of the second version of the website which served over 5000 page views a day.

	I continued to make improvements related to booking, ride listings, ride ratings, and other static marketing related pages.

	The main feature set I worked on was a corporate portal which provided features targeted towards enterprise customers that booked rides at a higher capacity. This required constant collaboration with product managers, UX, and other developers.

*   Feb 2012 - Feb 2014: **Telogis** - **New Zealand**

    Full Stack Developer
    - Javascript, C#, Powershell, SQL
    - Route Delivery Optimization and Logistics

    At Telogis I worked on the interface and backend for a 'Traveling Salesman Problem' solver. The product integrated tightly with multiple different services such as a real-time fleet tracker.

    I worked throughout the stack from the client with Ext JS and Silverlight, to the backend with C# SQL and powershell to automate tasks. I also helped in recruiting by giving employer presentations and attending job fairs.

* 	 Nov 2011 - Feb 2012: **HITLab, University of Canterbury** - **New Zealand**

    Game Developer
    - Javascript, C#, Unity3D
    - Effective Design Processes for Educational Computer Games

    At the HITLab (Human Interface Technology Laboratory) I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players about geothermal energy - it's applications and methods of harnessing. I scripted interactions and events with C# and javascript.

    The game won an internationally recognized 'Student Award', more information can be found here: [http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443](http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443)
