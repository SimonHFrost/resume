I'm a front-end developer that has over four years of experience developing solutions with a range of technology while collaborating with all sorts of teams and people.

I'm experienced with Backbone.js, Angular, Gulp, Sass, Browserify, and ES2015. But also maintain a strong foundation of web technologies like raw Javascript, CSS, and HTML by keeping up to date with new specifications - and using it plain javascript where possible instead of falling back to 'insert favorite framework here'

I believe that there is no superior programming language or framework, and that each problem should be analysed individually for it's needs.

My goal is to programatically increase the user experience, without compromising security. All with the acknowledgement, that things can't always be perfect when there are time constraints.

Work Experience
-

*  Feb 2016 - Present: **Number26** - **Berlin**

	Frontend Developer
	- Javascript, Backbone, SASS, Gulp
	- Banking but better

	At Number26 I developed features and fixed bugs for the web application which served around 25,000 page views a day. There was also a strong focus in improving code quality and tooling, as the project changed from outsourced development to being managed inhouse.

	there was a higher focus on design and ux so I had the chance to learn more about css and web animations while still delivering features

	Features I worked on included a bank account switching service, a transaction screen redesign, and overdraft functionality.

	I worked with Kanban in feature teams which contained web developers, product managers, designers, mobile developers, and backend developers.

*  Oct 2014 - Jan 2016: **Blacklane** - **Berlin**

    Frontend Developer
    - Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, SASS
    - Your Professional Driver

	At Blacklane I assisted with the release of the second version of the website which served over 5000 page views a day.

	I continued to make improvements related to booking, ride listings, ride ratings, and other static marketing related pages.

	The main feature set I worked on was a corporate portal which provided features targeted towards enterprise customers that booked rides at a higher capacity. This required constant collaboration with product managers, UX, and other developers.

    Full Stack Developer
    - Javascript, C#, Powershell, SQL
    - Route Delivery Optimization and Logistics

    At Telogis I worked on the interface and backend for a 'Traveling Salesman Problem' solver. The product integrated tightly with multiple different services such as a real-time fleet tracker.

    At the HITLab (Human Interface Technology Laboratory) I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players about geothermal energy - it's applications and methods of harnessing. I scripted interactions and events with C# and javascript.

    The game won an internationally recognized 'Student Award', more information can be found here: [http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443](http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443)
