I excel in delivering features that cater to both the user and the business while also focusing on code quality to reduce development complexity. I have five years of professional experience as a software engineer, mainly as a front-end engineer.

I believe that being a good programmer is more than just writing good code as issues can arise from many areas. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tooling are all skills I've learned over the years in different teams with various roles that are constantly changing.

Work Experience
---------------

*  Feb 2016 - Present: **Number26** - **Berlin**

	Front-end Developer
	- Javascript, Backbone, Sass, Gulp
	- Banking but better
	- Bathroom DJ

	At Number26 I worked on the web application which served half a million page views a month. There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while also improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from an outsourced contractor.

	There was a high focus on design and user experience as I worked with Kanban in a team of talented designers, product managers and other engineers.

	Features I worked on included a bank switching service, transaction screen redesign, overdraft application process. I also maintained a negative line contribution to the project - as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by removing code duplication and introducing best practices.

*  Oct 2014 - Jan 2016: **Blacklane** - **Berlin**

    Front-end Developer
    - Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, Sass
    - Your Professional Driver

	At Blacklane I assisted with the release of the second version of the website which served over 150,000 views a month.

	I continued to make improvements related to booking, ride listings, ride ratings, and other static marketing related pages.

	The main feature set I worked on was a corporate portal which provided features targeted towards enterprise customers that booked rides at a higher capacity. This required constant collaboration with product managers, UX, and other engineers.

*   Feb 2012 - Feb 2014: **Telogis** - **New Zealand**

    Full Stack Developer
    - Javascript, C#, SQL, PowerShell
    - Route Delivery Optimization and Logistics

    At Telogis I worked on the interface and backend for a 'Traveling Salesman Problem' solver. The product integrated tightly with multiple different services such as a real-time fleet tracker.

    I worked with front-end technologies such as Ext JS and Silverlight, as well as backend technologies such as C#, SQL and PowerShell. I also helped in recruiting by giving employer presentations and attending job fairs.

* 	 Nov 2011 - Feb 2012: **HITLab, University of Canterbury** - **New Zealand**

    Game Developer
    - Javascript, C#, Unity3D
    - Effective Design Processes for Educational Computer Games

    At the 'Human Interface and Technology Laboratory' I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players the application and methods of harnessing geothermal energy. I scripted interactions and gameplay with C# and javascript alongside another student that made models and animations.

    The game won an internationally recognized student award, more information can be found here: [http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443](http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443)
