I excel in delivering technical solutions that cater to both users and businesses while improving code quality to reduce future development complexity. I have five years of professional experience as a software engineer in a variety of roles, most recently as a front-end engineer.

I believe that being a good engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.

# Work Experience

## N26

* Banking but better
* Berlin, Germany
* Front-end Developer
* Feb 2016 - Present
* Javascript, Backbone, Sass, Gulp

At Number26 I improved and maintained a banking application which served over 500,000 views a month.

There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from an outsourced contractor. There was also a high focus on design and UX while collaborating with a team of talented designers, product managers and other engineers.

Features I worked on included a bank switching service, transaction screen redesign, overdraft functionality, premium card ordering, and bank migration. I also achieved more line removals than additions to the project, as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by minimizing code duplication and introducing best practices.

## Blacklane

* Your Professional Driver
* Berlin, Germany
* Front-end Developer
* Oct 2014 - Jan 2016
* Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, Sass

At Blacklane I improved and maintained the second version of a limousine booking application which served over 150,000 views a month.

Blacklane received Tech5's 'Fastest growing startup in Germany' in 2015, which meant that I was heavily involved in adapting our development methodology as the company grew and transitioned to Scrum. I also evaluated and implemented core technology such as AngularJS, and the introduction of Gulp.

Features I worked on included a corporate portal, enhancements to the booking form, ride listing improvements, ride ratings, and static marketing/SEO related pages.

## Telogis

* Route Delivery Optimization and Logistics
* Christchurch, New Zealand
* Full stack developer
* Feb 2012 - Feb 2014
* Javascript, C#, SQL, PowerShell

At Telogis I worked on the interface and backend for a traveling salesman problem solver. The product was used by numerous large American companies such as Coca-cola and Verizon.

The product was mathematically technical in nature and I worked alongside many talented PhD and Masters degree graduates. Working as a full stack developer as my first position outside of University was great exposure to a range of different technologies.

Features I worked on included a route templating system, routing algorithm memory optimziations, user creation and modification tooling, and testing improvements such as the introduction of BDD.

## HITLab

* Effective Design Processes for Educational Computer Games
* University of Canterbury, New Zealand
* Game Developer
* Nov 2011 - Feb 2012
* Javascript, C#, Unity3D

At the Human Interface and Technology Laboratory (HITLab) I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players the application and methods of harnessing geothermal energy.

The focus of the project was to identify aspects that enhance learning such as the concept of 'flow' which is a state between being overwhelmed and underwhelmed and consequently feeling engaged to learn. The game won an internationally recognized student award, more information can be found here: [http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443](http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443)

Features I worked on included the initial creation of the project, interactions with objects and NPCs, environment creation, and sequencing of models and animations.
