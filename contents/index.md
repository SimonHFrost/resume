I have over four years of professional experience as a software engineer, most recently as a front-end engineer. I excel in delivering features that improve user experience, while also focusing on code quality to maintain deployment velocity and future code maintainability.

I believe there is no superior programming language or framework, and that projects should be analyzed for their individual needs. I understand that most issues arise from invalid assumptions, and that effective communication can mitigate this. I have experience working and communicating in teams with multiple roles that constantly changing.

Work Experience
---------------

*  Feb 2016 - Present: **Number26** - **Berlin**

	Front-end Developer
	- Javascript, Backbone, Sass, Gulp
	- Banking but better
	- Bathroom DJ

	At Number26 I worked on the web application which served half a million page views a month. There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while also improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from an outsourced contractor.

	There was a high focus on design and user experience as I worked with Kanban in a team of talented designers, product managers and other engineers.

	Features I worked on included a bank switching service, transaction screen redesign, overdraft application process. I also maintained a negative line contribution to the project - as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by removing code duplication and introducing best practices.

    Front-end Developer
    - Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, Sass

	At Blacklane I assisted with the release of the second version of the website which served over 150,000 views a month.

	I continued to make improvements related to booking, ride listings, ride ratings, and other static marketing related pages.

	The main feature set I worked on was a corporate portal which provided features targeted towards enterprise customers that booked rides at a higher capacity. This required constant collaboration with product managers, UX, and other engineers.
