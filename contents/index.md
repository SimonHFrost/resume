I excel in delivering technical solutions that cater to both users and the business while improving code quality to reduce future development complexity. I have five years of professional experience as a software engineer in a variety of roles, most recently as a front-end engineer.

I believe that being a good engineer is more than just writing good code. Communicating effectively, identifying invalid assumptions, and choosing the right tools are all skills I've learned that minimize risk and maximize efficiency.

Work Experience
---------------

 	- Number26
	- Banking but better
	- Berlin, Germany
	- Front-end Developer
	- Feb 2016 - Present
	- Javascript, Backbone, Sass, Gulp

	At Number26 I worked on the web application which served half a million page views a month. There was a strong focus on rapid feature deployment while also improving code quality and tooling as the project was taken over from an outsourced contractor.

	There was a high focus on design and UX as I worked with Kanban in a team of talented designers, product managers and other engineers.

	Features I worked on included a bank switching service, transaction screen redesign, overdraft, premium card, migration. I also maintained a negative line contribution to the project - as a sign of my commitment to improve code quality by removing code duplication and introducing best practices.

	- Blacklane
	- Your Professional Driver
	- Berlin, Germany
	- Front-end Developer
	- Oct 2014 - Jan 2016
	- Javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Gulp, HAML, Sass

	At Blacklane I worked on the second version of the web application which served over 150,000 views a month.

	Tech5 'Fastest growing startup in Germany' in 2015.

	I continued to make improvements related to booking, ride listings, ride ratings, and other static marketing related pages.

	The main feature set I worked on was a corporate portal which provided features targeted towards enterprise customers that booked rides at a higher capacity. This required constant collaboration with product managers, UX, and other engineers.

	- Telogis
	- Route Delivery Optimization and Logistics
	- Christchurch, New Zealand
	- Full stack developer
	- Feb 2012 - Feb 2014
	- Javascript, C#, SQL, PowerShell

  At Telogis I worked on the interface and backend for a 'Traveling Salesman Problem' solver. The product integrated tightly with multiple different services such as a real-time fleet tracker.

  I worked with front-end technologies such as Ext JS and Silverlight, as well as backend technologies such as C#, SQL and PowerShell. I also helped in recruiting by giving employer presentations and attending job fairs.

	- HITLab
	- Effective Design Processes for Educational Computer Games
	- University of Canterbury, New Zealand
	- Game Developer
	- Nov 2011 - Feb 2012
	- Javascript, C#, Unity3D

  At the 'Human Interface and Technology Laboratory' I obtained a scholarship and worked with a PhD student to develop a prototype game that taught players the application and methods of harnessing geothermal energy. I scripted interactions and gameplay with C# and javascript alongside another student that made models and animations.

  The game won an internationally recognized student award, more information can be found here: [http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443](http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&articleId=443)
